# Introduction to Unit Testing in JavaScript

## Installation

First, clone this repository. Once, you have it on your computer, navigate to the directory in the terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Starting Up

Run the following from your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is up and running, visit `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser.

## Getting Started

We'll be modifying four files as we complete these exercises:

- `block.js`
- `world.js`
- `block-test.js`
- `world-test.js`

## Phase One: Get the Tests Passing

There are a few dozen tests defined between `block-test.js` and `world-test.js`. Some of them are complete with assertions and a working implementation. Some of them are skipped tests just waiting for an implementation. The rest are empty shellsâ€”waiting for you to write some assertions followed by the implementation necessary to get them passing.

Your first job is to get the entire suite passing.

## Phase Two: Blaze Your Own Trail

### Blocky in the World

Blocks should be able to take a fifth argument: a `world` instance. The implementation might look something like this:

```js
function Block(x, y, width, height, world) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
  this.width = width;
  this.height = height;
  this.world = world;
}

// Block prototype methods omitted.
// World code omitted.

var world = new World(100, 100);
var block = new Block(0, 0, 25, 25, world);

// These would be two separate tests.
assert.equal(block.world, world);
```

Conversely, a world should be able to add blocks to itself. This might look something like this:

```js
World.prototype.addBlock = function (x, y, width, height) {
  // `this` is the current world instance that we're calling this method on.
  // We'll pass it as the fifth argument (see above).
  var block = new Block(x, y, width, height, this);
}
```
